# Hello, world!

In this lab we're going to learn the fundamentals of recursion by exploring some interesting data structures. No prior experience of a typical computer science curriculum is required - you'll quickly see that recursion is rather simple! We just ask that you're comfortable with basic JavaScript such as defining functions on `module.exports` and calling them.

We'll be using a lot of object syntax (i.e. `let obj = { key: "value" }`), so it may be helpful to brush up on that if you're unfamiliar.

But that's really it! Before we can dive in let's make sure your environment is set up and ready to solve some problems.

For our `first exercise`, create a file (program.js is what workshopper suggests but the name does not matter) that exports your current status like so:

```
exports.status = "I'm ready to start learning";
```

Save it, and enter `recursion-lab verify program.js` into your terminal (substitute program.js with your filename) to move on to lesson 2.
